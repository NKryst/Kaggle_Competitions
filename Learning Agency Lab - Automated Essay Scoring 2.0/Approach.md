## Intentions üòÅ

### 1. Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
#### Text Cleaning
* Normalization: Convert all text to lower case to maintain consistency.
* Noise Removal: Eliminate non-alphabetic characters, strip extra spaces, and correct misspellings.
* Tokenization: Break text into words or tokens to facilitate further processing.
* Stopword Removal: Exclude common words ('and', 'the', etc.) that might detract from important features.
* Lemmatization/Stemming: Reduce words to their base or root form.
#### Feature Extraction
* Bag of Words: Use as a simple baseline for feature extraction.
* TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency): Reflects the importance of a word to a document in a corpus, which is more useful than simple frequencies.
* Word Embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe): Utilize pretrained word vectors to capture semantic meanings.
* Sentence Embeddings: Aggregate word embeddings in a way that preserves sentence context.
* Syntactic Parsing: Dependency and constituency parses can help in understanding the grammatical structure of sentences, which might be useful for assessing essay quality.

###  2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Understand the Score Distribution: Analyze how scores are distributed across different essay sets and prompts to tailor models appropriately.
* Identify Common Themes and Keywords: Use clustering techniques to find common topics or clusters in essays, which might correlate with scores.
* Text Length vs. Score Analysis: Evaluate whether the length of an essay correlates with its score, as longer essays might inherently provide more detailed responses.

###  3. Model Development

#### Baseline Model
* Linear Models: Start with simple models like Linear Regression or Logistic Regression as a benchmark.
Advanced Models

* Ensemble Methods: Techniques like Random Forests and Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) that can handle non-linear relationships better.
* Neural Networks:
* CNNs: Convolutional Neural Networks, although typically used for image data, can be effective for sequence processing in text data.
* RNNs/LSTM/GRU: Recurrent Neural Networks, especially LSTMs and GRUs, are suited for handling sequences like text.
* Transformer Models: Leverage BERT or GPT-2/GPT-3 for state-of-the-art results. These models are pre-trained on large corpora and can be fine-tuned on the specific task of essay scoring.

#### Hybrid Models

* Combine different types of models to leverage their unique strengths. For example, use an ensemble of LSTM and a tree-based method.
### 4. Evaluation Strategy

* Cross-Validation: Use k-fold cross-validation to ensure that your model generalizes well over unseen data.
* Performance Metrics: Focus on optimizing the Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK), which is the official metric for the competition. This metric effectively reflects the agreement between the predicted scores and the actual scores, where a higher QWK score indicates better performance.

### 5. Post-processing

* Score Calibration: Adjust the final scores to ensure they conform to the expected distribution, potentially using simple rounding techniques or more sophisticated probabilistic methods.

###  6. Experimentation
* Hyperparameter Tuning: Use tools like Grid Search or Random Search to find the optimal settings for your models.
* Feature Selection: Experiment with adding or removing features to see the impact on model performance.
* Error Analysis: Regularly evaluate where your model is making errors and adjust your strategies accordingly.

### 7. Utilizing External Resources
* Pre-trained Models: Utilize models trained on large datasets to capture deep linguistic properties.
* Additional Data: If allowed, use external datasets for training to enhance model robustness.
