# Kaggle_Competitions

## Intentions 😁

Welcome! This repository is my playground for delving into the realms of AI and Machine Learning through Kaggle competitions. Here, you'll find a mix of competitions that I've participated in, those I find particularly intriguing, and my submissions. The journey doesn't stop at competitions; I'll also include open-source research papers and valuable resources that I encounter along the way. This space is meant to document my learning curve and share insights with anyone interested in the intersection of AI, machine learning, and data science.

## Frequency

I plan to update this repository sporadically throughout the year, aligning my updates with times of personal leisure and festivity, notably during Christmas 🎅🎄, Easter 🐰, and the Summer months ☀️😎. Keep an eye out during these times for new insights and contributions!

## Playlist for Coding and Reading

To enhance the experience of exploring my repositories, I've curated a playlist that I listen to while working on these projects. Feel free to tune in and enjoy the vibe as you peruse through my work:
